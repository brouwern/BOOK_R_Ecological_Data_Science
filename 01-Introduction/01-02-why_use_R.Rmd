# What is R and why use it?

R is a powerful piece of software used for data science and data analysis.  In this chapter I will briefly introduce the advantages of using R for data science and data analysis, why you might want to learn it, and also indicate some alternatives and adjuncts you could consider.

## How do we typically use software in science?

### The well-funded scientists
A well-funced scientists might use many types of software to do their work:

* Data entry (pick 1)
    + Excel
    + increasingly Google Sheets
* Data analysis (pick 1)
    + Minitab
    + SAS
    + SPSS
    + STATA
* Making plots (pick 1)
    + export data back to Excel
    + SigmaPlot
* Other work (as needed)
    + GIS: ArcGIS
    + Mark-recapture & related analysis: ProgramMARK, Distance, etc
    + Modeling: MatLab, Python, RAMAS ecolab, Vortex, etc
    + Multivariate ecological statistics

### A typical scientist

A typical scientist will rely on Excel for data entry and cleaning and a program such as SAS or SPSS for data analysis.  They will then send their stats output back to Excel for graphing.

### The poorly funded scientists

Since software can be expensive, some scientists will rely on Excel for all of their work.

## What does R do?

* Math
* Statistics
* Data cleaning & organization
* It makes great-looking figures
* GIS
* You can write computer programs to automate these things
* You can write word processor-like documents that integrate all of these thigns

## Why use R

R is...
* free + for students, government, business, anyone
* used by statisticians to develop new statistical techniques + new techniques often come out 1st in R
* used by almost all ecological statisticians to develop new techniques (mark recapture, distance sampling)
* can stats, graphics, and modeling, all for free


## Who uses it?

Some examples

* Academics
* Data scientists
* Large companies: Facebook, John Deere, Monsanto
* Journalists: eg New York Times
* and many many more

## Free alternatives to R

* Jamovi
* JASP
