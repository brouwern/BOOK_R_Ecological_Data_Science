Brouwer 2018-09-13 Preface This book grew out of exercises used for the computer lab portion of ENS 495:Design &amp; Analysis, an ecological statistics course I taught for two years as and adjunct with the Department of Department of Biological &amp; Environmental Sciences at California University of Pennsylvania. The goal is to walk students step by step through the process of working with data in R. A major influence in how this book is written is th online book Program MARK: a gentle introduction, edited Evan Cooch and Gary White. MARK is one of the most important pieces of software ever written for ecologists and implements a vast number of mark-recapture and occupancy-type models for understanding population processes such as population size, survival, migration, occupancy, and meta-population dynamics. The book patiently walks users through the basic of these models step by step, concept by concept, and click by click. I have sought to adopt a similar thorough and holistic approach in this book. In Part I of this book I’ll introduce why the role of data science in ecology is important and lay out the scope of this book. I’ll also walk through the basic steps of getting R and RStudio up and running on your comptuer, walk through a basic R section, and discuss the various ways we’ll interact with R using code and script files. I’ll also introduce rmarkdown, a way of integrating the R code of scripts with basic capabilities of word processing and web developement. Scripts organized in rmarkdown are a handy way to organize and annotate code, store and disseminate your work, and structure your analyses and data presensations so that the computations behind them are fully reproducible.

[NOTE: This section is currently under development. The paper by Touchon &amp; McCoy (2016) and its references lay out many of the reasons for the statistical focus of this book.] “Ecological questions and data are becoming increasingly complex and as a result we are seeing the development and proliferation of sophisticated statistical approaches in the ecological literature. … It is no longer sufficient to only ask ‘whether’ or ‘which’ experimental manipulations significantly deviate from null expectations. Instead, we are moving toward parameter estimation and asking ‘how much’ and in ‘what direction’ ecological processes are affected by different mechanisms” (Touchon &amp; McCoy 2016, Ecosphere, emphsis mine) “Spreadsheets are often used as the basis of data collection and education; but this is potentially problematic since spreadsheets typically do not promote good data management practices…. The features of spreadsheets that make them desirable for the average researcher, such as extensibility, use of formatting for organization, embedding charts, make them undesirable for preparing data for long‐term archiving and reuse.”(Strasser &amp; Hampton 2012 Ecosphere) "],

People argue about what data science is What Tukey calls “data analysis” is now termed “data science” by many. Some define data science as closely allied with computer science and want its use most closely associated with things like “big data”, data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Others, such as RStudio’s Hadley Whickham (creator of ggplot2, dplyr, and most of the infrasture of the tidyverse of R package) define it more broadly to involve all aspects of the life cycle of data.

Most scientists rely on both general and specialized pieces of software for various parts of their work. For data entry they likely use spreadsheet software Excel, though increasingly Google Sheets. For data analysis they might use one of many options, such as GraphPad Prism, Minitab, SAS, SPSS, or STATA. For making plots, many people will export their export their results back to Excel, while others use specialized software like SigmaPlot. Many scientists also use specialized programs; in ecology many researchers do GIS in ArcGIS or QGIS, mark-recapture analysis in Program MARK or Distance, use RAMAS or Vortex for population viability analysis, or build custom mathematical programs in MatLab or Python. If they do multivariate statistics like [ordination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordination_(statistics) the may use a specialized stats program like PC-ORD. Since software can be expensive, some scientists will rely on Excel for all of their work. Excel can do many things, but it can’t do everything all the specialized types of software can do. Moreover, its very limited in the range of statistics it can do and graphs it can make. "],

["r-and-computational-reproducibility.html", "2.5 R and computational reproducibility", " 2.5 R and computational reproducibility One factor potentially contributing to R’s popularity, or at least a major bonus for using it, is ease of use for making analyses reproducible. All commands in R are typed out and the best way to do this is in a static script file from which you send commands to R to execute. This creates a record of your analyses. This feature is shared by other programs such as SAS and Stats, and other programming languages such as Matlab and Python. The advantage of R is that the script files are simply plain text files which anyone can open and - if they’ve downloaded R, which is free - they can run. Developers have also created numerous tools for creating reproducible analysis workflows and which allow R to be used in all data-related aspects of a project, from data cleaning to formatting journal submissions. What this means is that without become an expert programmer you can set up your work so that you can re-run all of your data cleaning, analyses, and graph building with a single command in R. This makes what you’ve done auditable, transparent, and easy to re-use for future work. "],
["alternatives-to-r.html", "2.6 Alternatives to R", " 2.6 Alternatives to R R has many advantages, but it has one critical issue: the learning curve. R is a command-line driven analysis tool, which means you type out specific commands for almost everything single thing R does. Excel is pretty user friendly, and several stats programs similarly use point-and-click interfaces, such as SPSS, JMP, and Stata SAS also requires a lot of command writing, but is generally consider more user friendly than R. Recently, two free point-and-click statistical analysis programs have been release that are built on R but require no programming. JASP (“Just another statistics program”) has an emphasis on Bayesian statistics, particularly Bayesian hypothesis testing using Bayes factors (an approach increasing in popularity, especially in psychology, but which some Bayesians, like Andrew Gelman, disavow). While JASP is based on R, it does not currently allow access to the underlying R code. Jamovi has a similar spirit as JASP (indeed, it was founded by developers who had worked on JASP) but is more transparent about the underlying R code being used to run the analysis. "],

(#fig:rstudio.logo)The RStudio logo When you open up you’ll be greeted by a fairly busy array of menus and things. Don’t panic! A typical fresh starting point in RStudio is shown in Figure 2. (#fig:rstudio.open)RStudio when first opened. When referring to RStudio, there are two terms that need to be understood. As shown in Figure 3, there is the console section of RStudio and the script editor or source viewer. (#fig:rstudio.console)RStudio’s console and script editor. A “cheat sheet” called the “RStudio IDE Cheat Sheet” details all of RStudio’s many features and is available at https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/ . It very thorough, though a bit dense. 3.5.2 The console versus the script editor You can type and enter text into both the console and the script editor. The console, however, respond like a calculator, while the script editor works more like a text editor. 3.5.2.1 The R console The console in RStudio act exactly the same way as it does in R. This is an interactive programming situation that is very similar to a scientific calculator. If you click your mouse inside the console and type “1 + 1” then press enter you will see the following type of output 1 + 1 ## [1] 2 Note that right in front of where you typed “1+1” there is a “&gt;” symbol. This is always in the R console and never needs to be typed. One thing to note about R is that it’s not particular about spacing. All of the following things will yield the same results 1+1 1 + 1 1 + 1 3.5.2.2 R’s console as a scientific calculator You can interact with R’s console similar to a scientific calculator. For example, you can use parentheses to set up mathematical statements like 5*(1+1) ## [1] 10 Note however that you have to be explicit about multiplication. If you try the following it won’t work. 5(1+1) R also has built-in functions that work similar to what you might have used in Excel. For example, in Excel you can calculate the average of a set of numbers by typing “=average(1,2,3)” into a cell. R can do the same thing except The command is “mean” You don’t start with “=” You have to package up the numbers like what is shown below using “c(…)” mean(c(1,2,3)) ## [1] 2 Where “c(…)” packages up the numbers the way the mean() function wants to see them. If you just do the following R will give you an answer, but its the wrong one mean(1,2,3) This is a common issue with R – and many programs, really – it won’t always tell you when somethind didn’t go as planned. This is because it doesn’t know something didn’t go as planned; you have to learn the rules R plays by. 3.5.2.3 Practice: math in the console See if you can reproduce the following results Division 10/3 ## [1] 3.333333 The standard deviation sd(c(5,10,15)) # note the use of &quot;c(...)&quot; ## [1] 5 3.5.2.4 The script editor While you can interact with R directly within the console, the standard way to work in R is to write what are known as scripts. These are computer code instructions written to R in a script file. These are save with the extension .R but area really just a form of plain text file. To work with scripts, what you do is type commands in the script editor, then tell R to excute the command. This can be done several ways. First, you tell RStudio the line of code you want to run by either * Placing the cursor at the end a line of code, OR * Clicking and dragging over the code you want to run in order highlight it. Second, you tell RStudio to run the code by * Clicking the “Run” icon in the upper right hand side of the script editor (a grey box with a green error emerging from it) * pressing the control key (“ctrl)” and then then enter key on the keyboard The code you’ve chosen to run will be sent by RStudio from the script editor over to the console. The console will show you both the code and then the output. You can run several lines of code if you want; the console will run a line, print the output, and then run the next line. First I’ll use the command mean(), and then the command sd() for the standard deviation: mean(c(1,2,3)) ## [1] 2 sd(c(1,2,3)) ## [1] 1 3.5.2.5 Comments One of the reasons we use script files is that we can combine R code with comments that tell us what the R code is doing. Comments are preceded by the hashtag symbol #. Frequently we’ll write code like this: #The mean of 3 numbers mean(c(1,2,3)) If you highlight all of this code (including the comment) and then click on “run”, you’ll see that RStudio sends all of the code over console. ## [1] 2 Comments can also be placed at the end of a line of code mean(c(1,2,3)) #Note the use of c(...) Sometimes we write code and then don’t want R to run it. We can prevent R from executing the code even if its sent to the console by putting a “#” infront of the code. If I run this code, I will get just the mean but not the sd. mean(c(1,2,3)) #sd(c(1,2,3)) Doing this is called commenting out a line of code. "],

If you start reading this help file, though, you don’t have to go far until you start seeing lots of R lingo, like “S3 method”,“na.rm”, “vectors”. Unfortunately, the R help files are usually not written for beginners, and reading help files is a skill you have to acquire. For example, when we load data into R in subsequent lessons we will use a function called “read.csv” Access the help file by typing “?read.csv” into the console and pressing enter. Surprisingly, the function that R give you the help file isn’t what you asked for, but is read.table(). This is a related function to read.csv, but when you’re a beginner thing like this can really throw you off. Kieran Healy as produced a great cheatsheet for reading R’s help pages as part of his forthcoming book. It should be available online at http://socviz.co/appendix.html#a-little-more-about-r 3.6.2 Getting help from the internet The best way to get help for any topic is to just do an internet search like this: “R read.csv”. Usually the first thing on the results list will be the R help file, but the second or third will be a blog post or something else where a usually helpful person has discussed how that function works. Sometimes for very basic R commands like this might not always be productive but its always work a try. For but things related to stats, plotting, and programming there is frequently lots of information. Also try searching YouTube. 3.6.3 Getting help from online forums Often when you do an internet search for an R topic you’ll see results from the website www.stackoverflow.com, or maybe www.crossvalidated.com if its a statistics topic. These are excellent resources and many questions that you may have already have answers on them. Stackoverflow has an internal search function and also suggests potentially relevant posts. Before posting to one of these sites yourself, however, do some research; there is a particular type and format of question that is most likely to get a useful response. Sadly, people new to the site often get “flamed” by impatient pros. 3.6.4 Getting help from twitter Twitter is a surprisingly good place to get information or to find other people knew to R. Its often most useful to ask people for learning resources or general reference, but you can also post direct questions and see if anyone responds, though usually its more advanced users who engage in twitter-based code discussion.

Quickly you’ll want to start keeping track of the code you write in class to refer back to. When you start doing analyses you’ll want to write comments as you go, and provide details at the top of your file so you can quickly get up to speed when you come back to the file. 4.3.1 What to include in a script A good R script should be a self-sufficient document that your future self can easily make sense of, or better yet, someone starting from scratch can understand.

So you write a lot of code then erase it, or scratch out code in a script and then move on. While I have written and saved many scripts that I have never re-opened, I have never re-opened a script and said “wow, I went WAY overboard annotating this thing!” ALso, commenting code makes it much easier to read; I often add fairly simple comments to make code easier navigate and to break things up into smaller chunks. So, at a minimum I think every script should Have some kind of header saying what it is and when it was made Have one line of comments or annotations for every 3 to 5 lines of code. 4.3.2 Formatting sections in R scripts To make scripts easier to navigate its useful to strong together the comment character “#” to make dividers and boxes. This is very good practice to make code more readable. It can be a bit tedious at times to do this; one advantage of rmarkdown, which we’ll introduce at the end of this chapter and go into further in the next, is that it makes it very easy to format section titles. 4.3.3 A sample R script On the following pages are examples of R scripts for a formal analysis of a dataset. First I’ll show what the script might look like as I write it. Then I’ll show how I’ll fix it up once I know its something I am going to look back at in the fugure ### R Script: Analysis of frog arm girth ## Nathan Brouwer (brouwern@gmail.com) ## 6/6/2018 ## update: 8/17/2018 ## I am re-running analysis from paper by Buzatto et al 2015 ## I want to compare the results of a t-test with ## and w/o Welche&#39;s correction for unequal variation ## Packages library(wildlifeR) ## Data set up # load frogarm data from Buzatto et al 2015 data(&quot;frogarms&quot;) ## Data visualization # histogram of all data hist(frogarms$sv.length) ## Data analysis # unpaired t-test NOT using Welch&#39;s correction ## NOTE: assumes variation within each group EQUAL t.test(sv.length ~ sex, # model formula var.equal = TRUE, # set variances to equal data = frogarms) # data # unpaired t-test &gt;&gt;using&lt;&lt; Welch&#39;s correctin t.test(sv.length ~ sex, var.equal = FALSE, # set variances to be unequal data = frogarms) 4.3.4 A polished R script ########################################### ### ### R Script: Analysis of frog arm girth ### ########################################### ## Author: Nathan Brouwer (brouwern@gmail.com) ## Creation: 6/6/2018 ## Last update: 8/17/2018 ############### ## Introduction ############### # This script is an analysis of frog body size and arm girth ## I am re-running analysis from paper by Buzatto et al 2015 ## I want to compare the results of a t-test with ## and w/o Welche&#39;s correction for unequal variation # Data were originally from # Buzatto et al 2015.

This is often one of the most frustrating steps for beginners because R, like most data analysis tools that aren’t spreadsheets, it seemingly very picky about how it wants to receive data. Luckily there’s a method behind the madness, and also some handy tools in RStudio to help with this. Most data starts off as a spreadsheet before it enters R. Loading spreadsheet data into R will be our end goal, but as a run up will step through several easier tasks that will highlight the core principles of getting data into R, in particular loading additional software into R (called packages) and loading the data in those packages into R. We’ll also load data directly from the internet into R.

Base R however is surrounded by a universe of extensions built by statistician, programmers, academics and businesses that use R for analyses. A lot of R’s functionality is found in these packages, including data sets, special plotting functions, and statistical tools for the analysis of complex data. Some of these are fairly standard and are downloaded along with base R and just need to be explicitly installed. Other have to be downloaded from the internet and installed. Most packages contain data in order to demonstrate what they do; working with data from packages will be covered in a later lesson. This book relies heavily on an R package I’ve written called “wildlifeR” (https://brouwern.github.io/wildlifeR/) that contains the datasets used throughout the book, as well as some helpful R functions I’ve written. Most R packages you’ll use are stored on the CRAN website where you download R (https://cran.r-project.org/). R and RStudio have functions and tools for downloading and managing packages that we’ll briefly introduce in this exercise. Another place a package can be stored online is a code repository like GitHub. The wildlifeR package lives on GitHub and can be downloaded directly from there. Many packages on CRAN also occur on GitHub, especially if programmers are actively developing, updating, and managing the package. We’ll cover downloading packages from GitHub in the next exercise. 6.1.1 Learning objectives This exercise will introduce students to the concept of an R Package (aka library) how to load R packages using the library() function the R plotting package ggplot2 cool add-ons to ggplot2, ggpubr and cowplot 6.1.2 Learning goals By the end of this exercise students should be able to locate and download packages from the CRAN website using RStudio recognize the R functions used to download and install packages. 6.1.3 Functions &amp; Arguements install.packages dependencies = TRUE library 6.1.4 Packages MASS ggplot2 ggpubr cowplot 6.1.5 Potential hangups quoted vs. unquoted text (eg qplot vs. ggpubr syntax) "],

A famous dataset frequently used in statistics is a set of measurements made on three species of irises and used to demonstrate some statistical principles by geneticist and statistician R.A. Fisher. We can put the iris dataset into R’s working memory using the data() command data(iris) We can see these data simply by type the word “iris” in the console and pressing enter. The dataset is too big for the screen probably and you’ll just see a bunch of numbers flash by. You can get just a glimpse of the data by using the head() command, which will show you the first six or so rows of data. head(iris) ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species ## 1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 2 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 3 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa ## 4 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa ## 5 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 6 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 setosa (You can all use the tail() command to see the last 6 rows if you want.) We can see that there are five rows of data. Three contain information about the length and width of the parts of the flower (Sepals and Petals) and the last holds the names of the species. We can get a sense for these numbers by using the summary() command on the data, which will give us the mean and other summary statistics summary(iris) ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width ## Min. :4.300 Min. :2.000 Min. :1.000 Min. :0.100 ## 1st Qu.:5.100 1st Qu.:2.800 1st Qu.:1.600 1st Qu.:0.300 ## Median :5.800 Median :3.000 Median :4.350 Median :1.300 ## Mean :5.843 Mean :3.057 Mean :3.758 Mean :1.199 ## 3rd Qu.:6.400 3rd Qu.:3.300 3rd Qu.:5.100 3rd Qu.:1.800 ## Max. :7.900 Max. :4.400 Max. :6.900 Max. :2.500 ## Species ## setosa :50 ## versicolor:50 ## virginica :50 ## ## ## Note that the last column doesn’t contain numbers but rather names, so R counts up how many of each species name there is.

This will bring up the data in a spreadsheet like viewer as a new tab in the script editor, similar to this. pander::pander(iris[1:10,]) Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa 4.9 3 1.4 0.2 setosa 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa 5 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 setosa 4.6 3.4 1.4 0.3 setosa 5 3.4 1.5 0.2 setosa 4.4 2.9 1.4 0.2 setosa 4.9 3.1 1.5 0.1 setosa Note, however, that unlike a spreadsheet you cannot edit the data. If you want to know more about a package, you can look at its help file, eg “?iris.” These will often give you a fair bit of detail about what each column means, where the data are from, and may even have examples R functions applied to the data (though these can be rather obtuse, as is the case for the iris data). 7.2.1 Preview: Plotting boxplots Plotting will be covered in depth in a subsequent exercise, but here’s a glimpse of how we plot things in R: plot(Petal.Length ~ Species, data = iris) This code creates a series of boxplots of the petal lengths of each species of flower.

Note that the qplot() function only works if you have ggplot2 downloaded and installed. A powerful aspect of ggplot is the fact that it can easily be used to modify plots.

The animals in this data vary in size from mice to elephants and so a lot of the data points are scrunched together.

We can load this data into R by making R objects, and then turning these objects into a dataframe. 7.6.1.1 Step one: Build R objects First, we’ll use the assignment operator (“&lt;-”) to create an R object called “year” that lists the years from 1980 through 2015 for which the number breeding pairs of eagles in Pennsylvania, USA, is known. year &lt;- c(1980,1981,1982,1983,1984,1985,1986,1987,1988,1989, 1990,1991,1992,1993,1994,1995,1996,1997,1998,1999, 2000,2001,2002,2003,2004,2005,2006,2007,2008,2009, 2010,2011,2012,2013,2014,2015,2016) A quick trick to do this much fast is year &lt;- c(1980:2016) Second, we’ll create an object called “eagles” with the number of breeding pairs (male and females paired up for making baby eagles) recorded each year. Note that most years in the 1980s are skipped because there is not data available. When data are missing we use NA. (Note that this is just NA, with not quotes around it). eagles &lt;- c(3, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA,NA,NA,NA, 7, 9, 15, 17, 19, 20, 20,23,29,43, 51,55, 64, 69, NA, 96,100,NA,NA,NA, NA,NA, NA, NA,252,277, NA) 7.6.1.2 Step two: Build dataframe We can then turn these two separate R objects into a dataframe eagle.df &lt;-data.frame(year, eagles) 7.6.2 Looking at the eagle data We can check that we have this R object by using the ls() command. ls() ## [1] &quot;crabs&quot; &quot;eagle.df&quot; &quot;eagles&quot; &quot;iris&quot; &quot;msleep&quot; &quot;my.abc&quot; ## [7] &quot;my.mean&quot; &quot;x&quot; &quot;year&quot; And we can confirm that its a dataframe using is() is(eagle.df) ## [1] &quot;data.frame&quot; &quot;list&quot; &quot;oldClass&quot; &quot;vector&quot; summary() will give us basic info on PA’s eagles summary(eagle.df) ## year eagles ## Min. :1980 Min. : 3.00 ## 1st Qu.:1989 1st Qu.: 18.00 ## Median :1998 Median : 29.00 ## Mean :1998 Mean : 61.53 ## 3rd Qu.:2007 3rd Qu.: 66.50 ## Max. :2016 Max. :277.00 ## NA&#39;s :18 Note that in the “eagles” columns it tells you the number of NAs (missing values). The summary() readout quickly tells us that the eagle population has changed dramatically. 7.6.2.1 Preview: Plotting the Eagle D We can plot the data in ggplot2 using qplot(). However, there is an excellent package that adds additional functionality to ggplot called ggpubr. This is fairly common in R: you have packages that add functions to R, and packages that add functions to other packages. We can install ggpubr using install.packages(). Note that the name of the package, ggpubr, is in quotes. install.packages(&quot;ggpubr&quot;) ggpubr requires another package, magrittr, which R tells you about in red text. When a package requires another package, its called a dependency because one package relies on another. ggpubr has magrittr as a dependency; ggpubr modifies ggplot2, so ggpubr has ggplot2 as a dependency. Occasionally you might try to load a package and it won’t automatically install or download the dependency, usually because its not yet downloaded. If this happens with magrittr we would just have to download it using “install.packages(”magrittr“)”. Once we have ggpubr loaded we can plot the eagle data using the handy function ggscatter() ggscatter(dat = eagle.df, y = &quot;eagles&quot;, x= &quot;year&quot;) "],

It is very popular with software developers, especially those creating open-source applications, and has also been adopted whole-hearted by many data scientists and data analysts. GitHub has many features and uses. One of the most basic ones is to use GitHub like Dropbox to R backup copies of code on GitHub. GitHub also can act like a kind of web server to host websites, online books like this one, and provide access to open source software. Many people working on R packages use GitHub to host their package while its being developed or expanded. When a package is finished, it often is then submitted to CRAN, and the version on GitHub is used as the developement version where new features are being developed and tested. You can access packages on GitHub to get the newest version before something has been submitted to CRAN, or packages that haven’t or maybe will never end up on CRAN. This book relies on a package I’ve written called wildlifeR for datasets and some functions. In this short exercise we’ll download a package from CRAN we need to interact with GitHub, and then download wildlifeR.

You can load it into R’s memory using the command “data()” data(iris) #Load the iris data 12.3.2 Look at the iris data We’ll look at the iris data using some commands like ls(), dim(), and names(). You can check that it was loaded using the ls() command (“list”). ls() You can get info about the nature of the dataframe using commands like dim() dim(iris) This tells us that the iris data is essentially a spreadsheet that has 150 rows and 5 columns. We can get the column names with names() names(iris) Note that the first letter of each word is capitalized. What are the implications of this? The top of the data and the bottom of the data can be checked with head() and tail() commands head(iris) #top of dataframe tail(iris) #bottom of dataframe Another common R command is is(), which tells you what something is in R land. is(iris) R might spew a lot of things out at you when you use is() usually the 1st item is most important. Here, it tells us that the “object” called “iris” in your workspace is 1st and foremost a “data.frame” A dataframe is essentially a spreadsheet of data loaded into R. You can get basic info about the data themselves using commands like summary(). summary(iris) Which variables are numeric? Which variables are categories/groups (aka “factors”)? If you wanted info on just 1 column, you would tell R to isolate that column like this, using a dollar sign ($). summary(iris$Sepal.Width) That is, that name of the dataframe, a dollar sign ($), and the name of the column. What happens when you don’t capitalize something? Try these intentional mistakes (but remove the “#” from in front of each one): #all lower case summary(iris$sepal.width) # this won&#39;t work #just &quot;s&quot; in &quot;sepal&quot; lower case summary(iris$sepal.Width) #this won&#39;t work either #or what if you capitalize &quot;i&quot; in &quot;Iris&quot;? summary(Iris$Sepal.Width) #won&#39;t work either The first two error messages are not very informative; the 3rd one (“Error in summary(Iris$Sepal.Width) : object ‘Iris’ not found”) does make a little sense.

If you have done this recently you can skip this step. library(devtools) install_github(&quot;brouwern/wildlifeR&quot;) #Note that text is quoted &quot; &quot; Recall that downloading a package and actually loading it into R’s active memory are different things. To actually use the package you need to use the library() command to load it into memory. 16.2.2 Load data The data we’ll be using is in a dataset called “frogarms” in the wildlifeR package. data(frogarms) #[_] You can find out information about these data using the ? command. Note that there are no parentheses required for this ( “?(frogarms)” is wrong) 16.2.3 Subset your data In this lesson we’ll be primariy working with a personalized subset of the data. This will allow us to See the effects of sample size by comparing the larger frogarms data to your subset See the effects of random variation on things like p-values The worksheet that accompanies this chapter is meant to facilitate these comparisons between the full (frogarms) and sub datasets, and also between you can classmates. The code that follows is focused on working with the subset we will generate below, but the same commands should also be run on the full frogarms dataset.

The 2sst task is easy to wrap your brain around (looking at the code behind a function); the 2nd is more advanced (debugging a function). 16.2.4.1 OPTIONAL (easy): Looking at the code behind a function ** This section is optional, but easy for beginners** Functions in R are typically written using R code. To see the underlying code you can type the function name in the console but nothing else, then run the command make_my_data2L The formatting of the output in the console might look a bit goofy; you can adjusted the conlse size so it looks better. This code is fairly long but is mostly fairly basic R commands and is a single function. In contrast, many R functions call other functions within them.. You can’t always see the underlying code for a function though. Try to look at the t.test function t.test 16.2.5 OPTIONAL (intermediate): Function defaults This section is optional “Statistics is the science of defaults” (6 November 2012, https://andrewgelman.com) See what happens when you run this code; note that there is no “my.code = …” bit in it (just to simplify things). make_my_data2L(dat = frogarms, cat.var = &quot;sex&quot;) Why does this work? Check out the helpfile using ?make_my_data2L, or look at the raw code as we just did. Notice that right after the function name is listed the following things dat my.code = “nlb24” cat.var n.sample = 20 with.rep = FALSE These are the arguements that make_my_data2L() takes. When an arugment name is followed by an “= …” that means a default has been set. If you call the function and don’t specify what you want for a specific arguement, R checks for pre-specified defaults and uses those as needed. Note that the use of defaults can be problematic, since you might use a deafult you didn’t intend to. Most defaults are sensible, and essential things like dataframes that need to be supplied rarely have defaults. 16.2.6 OPTIONAL (Advanced): Debugging a function This section is optional and not relevant for beginners When a function is not working, or you want to understand how it works, you can debug it. First, tell R that the next time you run the function you want to debug it debugonce(make_my_data2L) Then run the function make_my_data2L() This will create a new tab in debugger mode.

The SE is the standard deviation (SD) divided by the square root of the sample size. You can get the same size using the length() command.

["a-1st-encounter-with-dplyr-.html", "16.5 A 1st encounter with dplyr [_]", " 16.5 A 1st encounter with dplyr [_] dplyr is a package that provides numerous functions for manipulating data. It is part of the expanding tidyverse of packages sponsored in large part by RStudio. Hadley Whickham is the primary achitect of the tidyverse; he wrote many of the first packages in this framework and laidout the overall conceptual basis that other package authors follow. For more on dplyr see https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/ http://genomicsclass.github.io/book/pages/dplyr_tutorial.html We will use 2 dplyr handy functions summarize() / summarise() group_by() dplyr can use a syntax that involves “pipes”. This is a relatively recent innovation in R coding. You can string together R commands using the pipe function, %&gt;%. Note that the pipe function actually is implemented by the magrittr package. If you haven’t loaded ggplot, dplyr, or wildlifeR yet you might have to load up magrittr directly. library(magrittr) For more background info on pipes see http://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html https://seananderson.ca/2014/09/13/dplyr-intro/ When using pipes from magrittr, you start with data and follow it with an action you want done to it. So, for example, previously when we wanted the mean of the “mass”&quot; column we did this mean(my.frogs$mass) #[_] Which is kind of read like a normal mathematical equation or function, where you start from inside the parentheses and work out. Eg, this.is.read.2nd(this.is.read.1st) R let’s you nest as many functions as you want. If I want to round off my calculation I can wrap “mean(my.frogs$mass)” in “round(…)”&quot; round(mean(my.frogs$mass)) #[_] Using pipes to get the mean I write things more like a sentence Eg, this.is.read.1st %&gt;% this.is.read.2nd my.frogs$mass %&gt;% mean #[_] note parentheses after mean! Which reads kind of like “Take the mass column and the dataframe and apply the mean() function to it.” To round the mean we would do this my.frogs$mass %&gt;% mean %&gt;% round #[_] Which read left to right like a sentence is “Take the mass column, calculate the mean, and then round off the mean” Note that the round() command has an argument for how many digits you want to round to. You include that in the parentheses my.frogs$mass %&gt;% mean() %&gt;% round(digits = 2) #[_] 16.5.1 Optional: Piping everything [O] This section is optional Most people learn about pipes when doing data summarizing and cleaning with dplyr and friends. But pipes can be used in many (most?) context. Try this my.frogs$mass %&gt;% hist Not everythign works though. For example, I can’t figure out how to use pipes and t.test(). THere might be a way. my.frogs %&gt;% t.test(mass ~ sex) End optional section 16.5.1.1 dplyr’s summarize() command [_] Instead of mean(data$column) we can use summarise() (for the British) or summarize(), plus pipes. We can get the grand mean of just the mass column by loading dplyr using library() and then using the summarise() command library(dplyr) #[_] my.frogs %&gt;% summarise(mean(mass)) This is maybe more complicated than “mean(my.frogs\\(mass)&quot; or my.frogs\\)mass %&gt;% mean, but overall the pipe framework and summarise pays off when combined with group_by() in the next section "],

Here, we can say “take my.frogs, split up the data by the sex column, and apply the mean() function to each subset.” my.frogs %&gt;% #[_] the data group_by(sex) %&gt;% #the group_by() function applied to the sex column summarise(mean(mass)) #the mean() function, applied to mass. This might be a bit abstract when you first do it. Again, where starting with our whole dataframe (my.frogs), then its piped with %&gt;% over to group_by() function, which splits it essentially into a male and a female sub-dataset. Then these two subsets are piped again to mean(). Then the mean() function is applied to the mass column in each of these subsets. Note that the column heading in the output mean(mass), which is what is in summarise(). Also note that the output is a “tibble”, which is a common feature of the tidyverse. One thing that tibbles do is some reasonable rounding for you automatically. A handy thing about summarise() is you can pass it labels. The following code adds a sensible label by changing “summarise(mean(mass))” to “summarise(mass.mean = mean(mass))”, where “mass.mean = …” defines the label. my.frogs %&gt;% #[_] group_by(sex) %&gt;% summarise(mass.mean = mean(mass)) You can label things anything, eg “puppies”. my.frogs %&gt;% #[_] group_by(sex) %&gt;% summarise(puppies = mean(mass)) When I first started using dplyr I found this syntax confusing because people often use the name of the function for the name of the column heading, like this my.frogs %&gt;% #[_] group_by(sex) %&gt;% summarise(mean = mean(mass)) For some reason this trips me up because the word “mean” as a label here is not quoted; to me the word mean should be reserved for the function mean(). Also, in general you should always make both input and output output self-lableing. If you just look at the output, its not obvious what the “mean” being shown is. You can pass any summary function to summarise(). We can give it sd() to get the sd of mass by sex. Note that I define the column names using “mass.sd = …” my.frogs %&gt;% #[_] group_by(sex) %&gt;% summarise(mass.sd = sd(mass)) What makes dplyr::group_by and summarize() really powerful is that you can pass it multiple. summary functions at the same time. Here, I’ll pass mean() and sd(), naming both. my.frogs %&gt;% #[_] group_by(sex) %&gt;% summarise(mass.mean = mean(mass), #give me the mean! mass.sd = sd(mass)) #give me the sd! dplyr also has a handy function n() for getting your sample size. my.frogs %&gt;% #[_] group_by(sex) %&gt;% summarise(mass.mean = mean(mass), mass.sd = sd(mass), n = n()) 16.6.1 OPTIONAL: Using novel functions with dplyr [O] This section is optional If you have defined the my_sd1() function above you can pass it to summarise() too. my.frogs %&gt;% group_by(sex) %&gt;% summarise(mass.mean = my_sd1(mass)) End optional section "],

After first looking at a Cleveland dotplot, we’ll focus on boxplots but also consider some others, including violin plots. 17.2.1 Cleveland dot plot A useful tool for looking at your data is a Clevand dot plot. This is just the variable you are interested in (eg mass) plotted against its rank in the data set or some other organization scheme. This allows you to quickly spot an values that are really weird, such as typos. ggdotchart(data = my.frogs, x= &quot;i.row&quot;, y = &quot;mass&quot;, rotate = T) For more on Cleveland dotplots and data exploraiton see Zuur et al 2010.

Note that “mass” and “sex” are in quotes. ggboxplot(data = my.frogs, # the data frame y = &quot;mass&quot;, # y-axis: a continous variable; in quotes! x = &quot;sex&quot;) # x-axis: a group; in quotes! 17.2.3 Notched boxplot We’ll use the original frogarms dataframe first for this. These aren’t commonly used; the notches work kind of like confidence intervals to determine if medians are different. ggboxplot(data = frogarms, #full dataset y = &quot;mass&quot;, x = &quot;sex&quot;, notch = TRUE) Now try your own subset of the data. The Notch calculations likely get messed up with small samples sizes. R will likely give you several warnings in red. ggboxplot(data = my.frogs, #my subset y = &quot;mass&quot;, x = &quot;sex&quot;, notch = TRUE) 17.2.4 Filled boxplots Its good practice to accent plot elements that relate to different groups. ggplot and ggpubr make this really eas. We can add colored fill to the box plots using fill = “…”; note that it is “fill” not “color”. (Color changes the color of the lines). ggboxplot(data = my.frogs, y = &quot;mass&quot;, # quotes! x = &quot;sex&quot;, notch = TRUE, fill = &quot;sex&quot;) We can turn off the notching by adding a “#” character before it. This is called commenting out that line of code ggboxplot(data = my.frogs, y = &quot;mass&quot;, x = &quot;sex&quot;, #notch = TRUE, fill = &quot;sex&quot;) 17.2.5 Boxplots with raw data Its best to plot your raw data whenever possible. This works best with small datasets. We’ll do this by appending add = “point”. ggboxplot(data = my.frogs, y = &quot;mass&quot;, x = &quot;sex&quot;, #notch = TRUE, fill = &quot;sex&quot;, add = &quot;point&quot;) # add = &quot;point&quot;, with quotes!

Jittering is helpful when you have large datasets and want to avoid overlap in the points. We’ll append add = “jitter”. ggboxplot(data = my.frogs, y = &quot;mass&quot;, x = &quot;sex&quot;, fill = &quot;sex&quot;, add = &quot;jitter&quot;) # add = &quot;jitter&quot; 17.2.7 OPTIONAL: Jittering with ggplot2 [O] The following section is opptional ggpubr helps simplify ggplot2 code, but in doing so adds some constraints. You can combine ggpubr commands with regular ggplot2 code though. We’ll use the code we did above and also add “+ geom_jitter()” This code should produce a plot similar to the one above. Note that after &quot; fill = “sex”) &quot; there is a “+”, ( eg, &quot; fill = “sex”) + &quot; ) and that on the next line is &quot; geom_jitter()&quot; ggboxplot(data = my.frogs, y = &quot;mass&quot;, x = &quot;sex&quot;, fill = &quot;sex&quot;) + # need the plus! geom_jitter() # the jitter command We can make the jittering less extreme by adding “width = 0.1” within geom_jitter() ggboxplot(data = my.frogs, y = &quot;mass&quot;, x = &quot;sex&quot;, fill = &quot;sex&quot;) + #need the plus! geom_jitter(width = 0.1) #reduce the magnitude of the jitter End optional section 17.2.8 Label ggpubr axes A graph isn’t done until it has labels. This can get annoying in base R (eg plot()) graphics and ggplot2, but is easy in ggpubr. 17.2.8.1 Adding Axes lables Adding the arguements “xlab = …” and “ylab = …” adds axes labels. Always add units (eg “g” for grams) when applicable. ggboxplot(data = my.frogs, y = &quot;mass&quot;, x = &quot;sex&quot;, fill = &quot;sex&quot;, xlab = &quot;Sex&quot;, #x axis (horizontal); quotes! ylab = &quot;Mass (g)&quot;) #y axis (vertical) 17.2.8.2 Plot title The command “main = …” adds a main title at the top of the graph. This is not usually done for publications but useful for keeping track of things and for presentations. ggboxplot(data = my.frogs, y = &quot;mass&quot;, x = &quot;sex&quot;, fill = &quot;sex&quot;, add = &quot;jitter&quot;, xlab = &quot;Sex&quot;, ylab = &quot;Mass (g)&quot;, main = &quot;Mass of Australian frogs by sex&quot;) #Main title 17.2.8.3 Refining ggpubr plots Move the legend to the bottom using legend = “bottom”. ggboxplot(data = my.frogs, y = &quot;mass&quot;, x = &quot;sex&quot;, fill = &quot;sex&quot;, xlab = &quot;Sex&quot;, ylab = &quot;Mass (g)&quot;, main = &quot;Mass of frogs by sex&quot;, # main title legend = &quot;bottom&quot;) # location of legend Change the color palette; Note that the colors are within c(…). ggboxplot(data = my.frogs, y = &quot;mass&quot;, x = &quot;sex&quot;, fill = &quot;sex&quot;, xlab = &quot;Sex&quot;, ylab = &quot;Mass (g)&quot;, main = &quot;Mass of frogs by sex&quot;, legend = &quot;bottom&quot;, palette = c(&quot;green&quot;,&quot;blue&quot;)) # change pallete 17.2.9 Plotting multple plots with cowplot::plot_grid You can save just about anything as an R object, and we can save a plot to an R object. I will use the assignment operation (&lt;-) to assign the output of ggboxplot() to an object called “gg.my.frogs”. Note that here I am using my.frogs. gg.my.frogs &lt;- ggboxplot(data = my.frogs, y = &quot;mass&quot;, x = &quot;sex&quot;) Note that the code runs but nothing happens… We can see what we just made using is() is(gg.my.frogs) This indicates 1) gg.my.frogs is there and 2) it is a “gg” type R object. I can get the graph if I call just the object gg.my.frogs (eg, just type “gg.my.frogs” into the console and press enter, or highlight just the word “gg.my.frogs” in a script and execute the command) gg.my.frogs Now, Make an object using the full frogarms data gg.frogarms &lt;- ggboxplot(data = frogarms, #use original data y = &quot;mass&quot;, x = &quot;sex&quot;) Now plot both using the plot_grid() function from the handy cowplot package. plot_grid(gg.my.frogs, gg.frogarms) Add labels. Note that alignment is off sometimes. plot_grid(gg.my.frogs, gg.frogarms, labels = c(&quot;a)My fogs&quot;,&quot;b)All the frogs&quot;)) 17.2.10 Violin plots An interesting alternative to boxplot that works well with large data is the violin plot ggviolin(data = frogarms, #use original data y = &quot;mass&quot;, x = &quot;sex&quot;) 17.2.11 Optional: Histograms [0] The following is optional Histograms are excellent for data exploration. They generally work best with medium to large datasets. A basic histogram can be made using gghistogram(). Note that there is “x = …” but no “y = …”; the y-axis is computed by the graphing function. gghistogram(data = my.frogs, x = &quot;mass&quot;) A key concept for ggplot is faceting. Faceting occurring when a two panels of plots are made from a single dataset, and the panels are split by a categorical variable. We can add the arguement “facet.by.by = sex” to make 2 panels, one for female and one for male. Note that because there are only 10 frogs in each group, the graphs aren’t very useful. gghistogram(data = my.frogs, x = &quot;mass&quot;, facet.by = &quot;sex&quot;) Just as we did for histograms we can change the fill, add a title, etc. "],

The equation in all its glory is: \\[s^2 = {\\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n} \\left(Y_{i} - \\bar{Y}\\right)^{2}} {n-1}}\\] This can be disorienting if you aren’t used to looking at this notation. We’ll go over it for the sake of being thorough; we mostly need a general conceptual understanding of the variance right now. \\(Y_{i}\\) represents each data point, where “i” stands for “index”. \\(Y_{1}\\) is the 1st value in the dataset, \\(Y_{2}\\) is the second values in the data set etc. The Y with the bar over it, \\(\\bar{Y}\\) , is called “Y bar” and can be typed out as “Y.bar” in R. n is the sample size. \\(\\sum\\) is the summation operator (the Greek letter sigma). \\(\\left(Y_{i} - \\bar{Y}\\right)\\) is the difference between each value in the data (the Y.i) minus the mean value (the Y.bar). \\((Y_{i} - \\bar{Y})^{2}\\) indicates that each difference between a value and the mean should be squared. These are called the squared differences or squared deviations. \\(\\sum(Y_{i} - \\bar{Y})^{2}\\) indicates that all of these values should be summed together; this is called “the sum of squares”. Finally, the sum of is divided by n-1. So, the upshot is: we take each value in the dataset, subtract the mean from each value, square each of those differences, add them up, and divide them by the sample size minus 1. The variance shows up everywhere in stats, but mostly behind the scenes in calculations; less frequently is it reported, though it plays an important role in, among other things, genetics and stochastic demography. The bigger the variance, the more variability. However, because of the squaring that occurs in the numerator the variance is on scale all its own. The variance is therefore never plotted alongside the datae; this would be meaningless. The variance of the frogarm mass data is var(frogarms$mass) 18.2.2 Standard deviation (SD) The variance is a bit hard to wrap you mind around; easier and much more frequently reported in practice is the standard deviation. The standard deviation is just the square root of the variance. \\[\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n} \\left(Y_{i} - \\bar{Y}\\right)^{2}} {n-1}}\\] Taking the square root of the variance puts it back into the same scale as the raw data. The standard deviation can therefore be plotted alongside the raw data or the mean. THe standard deviation for the frogarm mass data is or equivalently sd(frogarms$mass) Since the standard deviation is the square root of the variance, it is always smaller than the variance (Eg s &lt; s^2) The standard error (and the variance) are both measures of variation. They indicate the amount of variation that occurs in the raw data. 18.2.3 Optional: Testing the numerical equivalence of 2 values The following is optional We can confirm that 2 values are numerically equivalent using the == operator: sqrt(var(frogarms$mass)) == sd(frogarms$mass) End optional section 18.2.4 Standard error (SE) The standard error is often neglected in elementary stats work but it is a central concept. The standard error is the standard deviation divided by the square root of the same size. \\[SE = \\frac{SD}{\\sqrt{N}}\\] A very important thing about the standard error: it is not a measure of variation. It does not indicate how much variation there is in the raw data. The SE is an indication of precision. Specifically, it indicates how confident we are about our estimate of mean from the data. The SE does depend on the amount of variation in the data, but also depends on the sample size (n). Base R does not have a function for the SE. We can calculate it like this sd(frogarms$mass)/sqrt(length(frogarms$mass)) This is a bit dense, so we can break it up. First, assign the numerator and denominator to seperate R objects using the assignment operator &lt;-. frog.sd &lt;- sd(frogarms$mass) frog.n &lt;- sqrt(length(frogarms$mass)) Then do the division The standard error is frequently used as error bars for plots of means. 18.2.5 Confidence Interval (CI) Confidence intervals are a deep topic in stats. We’ll just touch on them briefly. If you have calcualted the standard error (SE) you can approximate the 95% CI for a mean as \\[CI = 1.96*SE\\] That is, 1.96 (sometimes rounded just to 2.0) multipled by the SE. The 95% CI is argueably a better choice for an error bar around a mean than the SE (better yet plot both, which down the road we’ll show how to do). "],
["representing-variation-with-the-sd.html", "18.3 Representing variation with the SD", " 18.3 Representing variation with the SD ggpubr has a very hand function for calcualting means and plotting error bars around them. ggerrorplot() (gg error plot) is the main function, and the “desc_stat = …” arguement defines what exactly to plot. If for some reason you just want to plot means use “desc_stat = ‘mean’”, with mean quoted. For the standard deviation use “desc_stat = ‘mean_sd’” (Note that any time you have a plot with errorbarrs – and if you plot means you should have error bars – you need to define at least in the figure legend what the error bars are.) ggerrorplot(data = my.frogs, desc_stat = &quot;mean_sd&quot;, y = &quot;mass&quot;, x = &quot;sex&quot;) Again, the standard deviation is a measure of variation. 18.3.1 Representing precision with the SE ggerrorplot() actually defaults to making a plot of the mean +/- 1 standard error (SE). ggerrorplot(data = my.frogs, y = &quot;mass&quot;, x = &quot;sex&quot;) The means and 95% confidence interval are plotted with “desc_stat = ‘mean_ci’” ggerrorplot(data = my.frogs, y = &quot;mass&quot;, x = &quot;sex&quot;, desc_stat = &quot;mean_ci&quot;) Again, the SE and 95% CI are measure of precision. There can be lots of variation in a dataset (SD is high) but if you have collected a lot of data (N is arge), you should be able to estimate the mean with precision. In general, the more data you have, the more precise your estimate will be. You can see how more data increases precision by comparing the entire frogarms dataset against your personal subset. We can assign each plot to an object using the assignment operator “&lt;-” and then plot them side by side with plot_grid() from cowplot. #your data gg.my.frogs &lt;- ggerrorplot(data = my.frogs, y = &quot;mass&quot;, x = &quot;sex&quot;, desc_stat = &quot;mean_ci&quot;, ylim = c(1.25,3.75)) #all of the forgm data gg.all.frogs &lt;- ggerrorplot(data = frogarms, #changed data = ... y = &quot;mass&quot;, x = &quot;sex&quot;, desc_stat = &quot;mean_ci&quot;, ylim = c(1.25,3.75)) Now plot them together using cowplot::plot_grid(). Then means will be different because of random variation between the subsamples. What happens to the error bars?. plot_grid(gg.my.frogs, gg.all.frogs, labels = c(&quot;my frogs&quot;,&quot;all frogs&quot;)) Now, what if instead of the 95% CI we plotted the SD? What do you think that will look like? Adapt the code from above by changing “desc_stat = ‘mean_ci’” to “desc_stat = ‘mean_sd’”. "],
